### Hello

I am Jakub Konkol, a doctoral candidate at Rutgers, the State University of new Jersey. 

My work is using spectroscopic data to understand chemical systems either quantitatively, such as estimating concentration profiles for kinetics, or qualitatively, such as exploring intermolecular interactions.

I built many tools during my PhD to help me in my work, you might find some projects here that may help you too.

My website: [https://jakubkonkol.com](https://jakubkonkol.com)

### Projects:

**Porchlight** - a CLI and GUI for performing preprocessing on spectroscopic data, primarily vibrational spectroscopies.

**TwoDimSpectroscoPy** - A package for performing 2D-COS calculations and plotting.

**RutgersThesisTemplate** - A LaTeX thesis template for Rutgers SOE dissertations/theses/proposals.

**cornellNotes** - A LaTeX template to make printable pages for the Cornell note-taking system.
